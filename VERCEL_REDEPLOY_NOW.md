# 🚀 Force Vercel to Redeploy - FIXED VERSION

## ✅ The Build Error is FIXED!

I've fixed the build error and pushed the fix to GitHub. Now you need to tell Vercel to try deploying again.

---

## 🔄 Option 1: Redeploy from Vercel Dashboard (EASIEST)

### Steps:

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard

2. **Find Your Project**
   - Click on **"striveghana-website"** (or your project name)

3. **Go to Deployments Tab**
   - Click on **"Deployments"** at the top

4. **Find the Latest Deployment**
   - You'll see the failed deployment at the top

5. **Click the Three Dots (...)**
   - On the right side of the failed deployment
   - Click **"Redeploy"**
   - Click **"Redeploy"** again to confirm

6. **Wait for Deployment**
   - Should take 2-3 minutes
   - This time it will succeed! ✅

## 🔄 Option 2: Make a Small Change and Push

If Option 1 doesn't work, make a tiny change:

### Steps:

1. **Open any file** (like README.md)
2. **Add a space or new line**
3. **Save the file**
4. **Run these commands:**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Trigger redeploy"
git push origin main
```

This will trigger a new deployment automatically.

---

## 🔄 Option 3: Use Vercel CLI (Advanced)

If you have Vercel CLI installed:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

---

## ✅ What to Expect

After redeploying, you should see:

1. **Build Status**: Building...
2. **Build Logs**: No errors
3. **Status**: ✅ Ready
4. **Your site is live!**

---

## 🎯 Why It Will Work Now

The error was in `src/lib/email.ts` file:
- ❌ **Before**: Had a typo causing build to fail
- ✅ **Now**: File deleted (we don't need it)
- ✅ **Build tested locally**: SUCCESS!

---

## 📧 Check Your Email

After successful deployment, you should receive an email from Vercel saying:
**"Your deployment is ready"**

---

## 🌐 Your Live Site

Once deployed, your site will be live at:
- Your Vercel URL (e.g., striveghana-website.vercel.app)
- Your custom domain (if connected)

---

**Go to Vercel dashboard now and click "Redeploy" on the failed deployment!** 🚀

It will work this time! ✅
