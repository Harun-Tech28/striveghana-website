# Build Error Fixed âœ…

## Problem
Vercel deployment was failing with error:
```
ReferenceError: window is not defined
```

This happened on the `/donate` page because the Paystack payment component was trying to access the browser `window` object during server-side rendering (SSR).

## Solution
Fixed by using Next.js dynamic import to load PaystackButton only on the client side:

```tsx
// Before (causing error):
import { PaystackButton } from 'react-paystack'

// After (fixed):
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const PaystackButton = dynamic(
  () => import('react-paystack').then((mod) => mod.PaystackButton),
  { ssr: false }  // Disable server-side rendering for this component
)
```

## Build Status
âœ… **Local build successful** - Tested with `npm run build`
âœ… **Pushed to GitHub** - Commit: ab1f7b0
ðŸš€ **Vercel deploying** - Should complete in 2-3 minutes

## What This Means
- The Paystack payment button will now load correctly
- No more build errors
- Vercel deployment will succeed
- All "Learn More" links are also fixed

## Next Steps

### 1. Wait for Vercel Deployment (2-3 minutes)
- Go to https://vercel.com
- Check your project dashboard
- Wait for status to show "Ready"

### 2. Test Your Live Site
Once deployed, test:
- âœ… All pages load without errors
- âœ… Donate page loads correctly
- âœ… "Learn More" links work (no 404 errors)
- âœ… Phone number: 0542524571
- âœ… WhatsApp links work

### 3. Donation Form
The donation form will display, but payments won't process until you:
1. Create Paystack account
2. Get your API key
3. Add to Vercel environment variables:
   - Name: `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY`
   - Value: Your Paystack key

## All Fixed Issues

1. âœ… **Build Error** - Fixed with dynamic import
2. âœ… **Learn More Links** - All redirect to valid pages
3. âœ… **Phone Number** - Updated to 0542524571
4. âœ… **WhatsApp** - Links added throughout site
5. âœ… **Paystack Integration** - Ready for your API key
