# Learn More Links - All Fixed ✅

## Problem
"Learn More" buttons were linking to individual program pages (e.g., `/programs/new-muslim-care`) that don't exist, causing 404 errors.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Home Page (`src/app/page.tsx`)
- **Program Cards "Learn More"** → Now links to `/programs` (main programs page)
- **Hero "Learn More" Button** → Links to `/about` (working correctly)
- **"Become a Mentor" Learn More** → Links to `/get-involved` (working correctly)

### 2. Programs Page (`src/app/programs/page.tsx`)
- **Program Cards "Learn More"** → Now links to `/contact` (so users can inquire)
- **"Learn More About This Program" Button** → Changed to "Contact Us to Join" and links to `/contact`

### 3. Other Pages
- **Donate Page** → "Learn More" links to `/get-involved` (working correctly)
- **Contact Page** → "Contact us to learn more" is just text (no link issue)

## All Working Links Now:

✅ **Home Page:**
- Hero "Learn More" → `/about`
- Program Cards "Learn More" → `/programs`
- "Become a Mentor" → `/get-involved`

✅ **Programs Page:**
- Program Cards "Learn More" → `/contact`
- "Contact Us to Join" → `/contact`

✅ **Donate Page:**
- "Learn More" → `/get-involved`
