## Solution: Activate Payment Channels

### Step 2: Navigate to Settings

## Quick Test After Activation

### Option 1: Test with Card Only (Fastest)
Update your donation form to only use card payments initially:

1. In your donation form, temporarily remove mobile money option
2. Test with card: **4084084084084081**
3. Once working, re-enable mobile money

### Option 2: Wait for Approval
- Card payments usually activate immediately in test mode
- Mobile Money might need approval (1-2 business days)
- You can test cards while waiting for mobile money approval

## Alternative: Simplify Payment Channels

If you want to test immediately, I can update your form to:
1. **Only use card payments** for now
2. Remove the channel restriction in Paystack config
3. Let Paystack auto-detect available channels

Once channels are activated:

2. Try the donation again
3. Use test card: **4084084084084081**
